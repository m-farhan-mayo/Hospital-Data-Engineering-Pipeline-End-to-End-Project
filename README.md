# Hospital-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-End-to-End-Project
End-to-end Hospital Data Engineering project using Databricks Free Edition. Generates local raw CSV/JSON data, processes it through Bronze–Silver–Gold layers, with cleaning, flattening, incremental loads, upserts, and SCD Type-2 to build a complete analytics-ready healthcare pipeline.


📁 1. Data Generator Script (Local System)
Creates all raw CSV + JSON hospital data so you can run the pipeline without any external systems.

🏛️ 2. Medallion Architecture Structure
Clear folders for Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to help you understand the full flow.

📄 3. Step-by-Step Documentation
Guides you through ingestion, cleaning, incremental processing, upserts, and SCD Type-2 — perfect for learning.

📊 4. Star Schema Outputs
Final fact and dimension tables to demonstrate an analytics-ready dataset.

This project is designed for self-learning, especially for anyone practicing Databricks, Delta Lake, or real-world data engineering workflows.
Feel free to explore, clone, customize, and build on it — hope it helps someone the way it helped me learn! 🚀
